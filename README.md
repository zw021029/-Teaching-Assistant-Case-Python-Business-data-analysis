This is a learning material for the "Python Business Data Analysis" course in SHU where I am a teaching assistant.

This project is based on machine learning data analysis, suitable for beginners who have a basic grasp of python or researchers who are interested in it, mainly including the following contents:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  2. Regression and Classification
  3. Clustering and Dimension Reduction
  4. Web Crawler and Text Analysis
  5. Association Rule
  Others are being added...

It is worth mentioning that Sirius YUAN HAO(https://github.com/sirius2alpha) has done an excellent job in enriching and supplementing the Web Crawler and Text Analysis of this project
